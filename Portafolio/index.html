                When I found out I was going to be learning how to
                work with CSS, I was about to break down into tears -
                happy tears, of course! I could not believe one of my
                lifelong dreams was about to come true: I would be
                learning the most beautiful style sheet language in
                the whole world. It was not always easy, though -
                there were some bumps on the road. But with my steely
                determination and the help from my extremely talented,
                knowledgeable and humble teacher, I was able to
                overcome every difficulty that came upon me. Maybe
                learning CSS is the best thing that has ever happened
                to me; it has spurred my creativity in ways I no
                longer thought possible. I will always love and
                cherish CSS and here are some of my delicately crafted
                webpages to attest to it.

                <h2>(Not so) Plain CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    I am not afraid to admit my first jobs are not
                    exactly stellar. At least I can see a steady
                    progress, and after all, learning a new language
                    was never going to be easy. I could see CSS was
                    going to be as challenging as fascinating, and
                    that made me all the more excited. We can all see
                    these were no masterpieces, but
                    <span>Vanilla CSS</span> is full of charm anyway,
                    don't you think?

                <h2>Float? Why not?</h2>
                <p>
                    We all love floating. It's so much fun and
                    sometimes unpredictable, which makes it even more
                    exciting. When I was learning how to use
                    <span>floats</span>, I would often find myself
                    daydreaming and thinking about
                    <span>the perfect CSS file</span>. Would I ever be
                    able to create the ultimate CSS file? Would I ever
                    get millions of people to praise my code's
                    pristine beauty? Only time will tell...

                <p>
                    Location, location, location. Thatâ€™s all that
                    mattered to me at some point. I was getting
                    frustrated! For some reason some CSS elements
                    refused to position themselves where I wanted them
                    to be. Luckily, my new best friend position came
                    to the rescue. All my prayers had been answered,
                    at last. I positioned elements everywhere at the
                    drop of a hat, and all of them simply complied. I
                    was feeling more powerful than ever before, but
                    the road to enlightenment was still full of twists
                    and turns.

                <h2>Mind-bending FlexBox</h2>
                <p>
                    Oh, <span>FlexBox</span>. You will always be
                    special to me. You showed me there are other ways
                    to design complex webpage layouts, and I will
                    never forget about that. It is as if you unlocked
                    a door for me, a door which lead the way to a
                    magic fantasy land where my creativity could
                    finally run unbridled and free. I was no longer
                    tied to restrictions - if I could imagine it, I
                    could code it. And that was all thanks to you,
                    <span>FlexBox</span>. I am sure we will be friends
                    forever.

                <h2>A serious affair: CSS Grid</h2>
                <p>
                    Just when I thought I knew how to use CSS, along
                    came <span>CSS Grid</span>. I am not gonna lie, I
                    was scared at first. <span>Grid</span> is the
                    gateway to a complex, bidimensional world. But at
                    the same time it is so tempting, intriguing and
                    sexy. With <span>FlexBox</span> and
                    <span>Grid</span> I felt truly unstoppable, and
                    once I got the hang of it, I finally unlocked all
                    my full potencial as a frontend developer. The
                    world is my oyster now, and I'm certainly here for
                    it. <span>CSS Grid</span> made it happen, and it
                    helped me become the best coder I can possibly be.

                    The icing on the cake was
                    <span>Responsive Web Design</span>. I felt like
                    the most powerful wizard, shaping the most
                    intricate layouts and creating order from chaos.
                    Just with a little tweaking, I manifested my most
                    fascinating and out-there ideas onto the code. CSS
                    had no secrets for me anymore. Finally, I became a
                    superlative "CSS whisperer".I am CSS and CSS is
                    me. You can call me a rockstar frontend developer.
